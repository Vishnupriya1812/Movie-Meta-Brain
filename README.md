# Movie-Meta-Brain

Movie Meta Brain, a Question Answering model based on RoBERTa-base-squad2, finetuned through Knowledge Graph (KG) in an unsupervised environment, facilitating the extraction of pertinent information for movie search queries. The KG extracted relevant and similar documents to the queries, generated post web scraping using Beautiful Soup. The model achieved an exact match f1 score of 70% for predicted answers. To monitor and assess model performance iteratively, the Weights and Biases Platform was employed.
